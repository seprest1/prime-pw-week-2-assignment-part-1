    <!-- If you have any questions, add them in paragraph tags here! -->

    <p>I don't understand the task for the #16. It says to "correctly check 'pets' and 'friendsPets', but against what? 
      Check that combined, the two variables are less than/equal to petsAllowed? Then it says assign highest value to 
      mostPets? like, highest amount of pets both me and my friend can have, combined? Wouldn't that just be the same
      as petsAllowed? Am confused. </p>
